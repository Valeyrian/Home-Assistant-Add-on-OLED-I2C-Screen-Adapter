# Home Assistant Add-on: OLED I2C Screen Adapter

This Home Assistant add-on enables the use of an OLED screen via I2C on a Raspberry Pi running Home Assistant Operating System (HA OS).  
HA OS typically restricts direct access to I2C due to system permissions, but this add-on bypasses those limitations by leveraging the Supervisor.

## Features

- **I2C Screen Support**: Compatible with OLED screens using GME12864, SSD1306, or SH1106 controllers.
- **MQTT Integration**: Receives data via MQTT topics to display system info like CPU temperature, memory usage, and network status.
- **Customizable Display Logic**: The `display_controller.py` script can be modified to define new display modes, MQTT topics, or behaviors.
- **Supervisor Execution**: Ensures compatibility with HA OS by executing with Supervisor permissions.
- **UI-Based Configuration**: Add-on options are configurable through the Home Assistant interface
