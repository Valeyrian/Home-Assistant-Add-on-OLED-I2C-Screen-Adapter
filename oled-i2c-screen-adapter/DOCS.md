# Installation

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that I2C is enabled on your Raspberry Pi.  You must enable it manually by editing the `config.txt` file in the boot partition of your Raspberry Pi.:
    ```txt
    dtparam=i2c_arm=on
    dtparam=i2c1=on
    ```
    (This add-on does **not** enable I2C automatically.)

2. Access your Home Assistant instance via SSH or SFTP to upload the custom add-on.


## Steps

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the repository folder into a **subfolder** inside the addons directory of your Home Assistant instance. This subfolder must have the exact same name as the `slug` defined in `config.json`, using **only** lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (no capital letters or special characters).
3. Restart Home Assistant to detect the new add-on.
4. Navigate to **Settings > Add-ons** in Home Assistant and install the add-on.
5. Configure the add-on via the Home Assistant UI.

For advanced users, you can manually edit the `config.yaml` file inside the add-on folder to customize settings beyond the UI options. However, this is usually not necessary.

## MQTT Topics

The screen listens for MQTT messages on the following topics:

| Topic                         | Description                           |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `screen/gme12864/text`       | Send text to display                   |
| `screen/gme12864/command`    | Send commands (`clear`, `on`, `off`)   |
| `screen/gme12864/mode`       | Change mode (`auto`, `manual`, etc.)   |
| `screen/gme12864/brightness` | Adjust brightness                      |
| `screen/gme12864/refresh`    | Change refresh interval                |

You can freely extend or change these topics by editing the `display_controller.py` file.

# Usage 
##   Display Modes

The add-on supports multiple display modes:

| Mode     | Description                                                              |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `auto`   | Automatically rotates through all screens                                |
| `manual` | Static custom message sent via MQTT                                      |
| `system` | Shows CPU usage, memory, uptime                                          |
| `network`| Displays IP and network status                                           |
| `sensors`| Shows sensor data (must be implemented manually in `display_controller.py`) |

##  Customization

You can customize the display logic by editing the `display_controller.py` script. This allows you to add new display modes, change MQTT topic handling, or build menu systems. Advanced users are encouraged to enhance this file according to their needs.

> While the `config.yaml` file can also be edited manually Most configurations can be handled through the Home Assistant UI.

#  Warnings & Important Notes

- **The I2C screen must be connected before starting the add-on.**
- If you change MQTT topics or display modes manually in `display_controller.py`, make sure they match your MQTT publisher configuration.
- Incorrect I2C address or port may cause the screen to stay black or the add-on to crash silently.
- This add-on **requires Home Assistant OS with Supervisor access**. It won't work with Home Assistant Core or Container.
- You must configure **valid MQTT credentials** if your broker is protected (which it usually is).


---

#  Troubleshooting

### Screen doesn't turn on
- Check that I2C is enabled on the Pi (`dtparam=i2c_arm=on`).
- Make sure the screen is connected to the correct pins and powered.
- Double-check the I2C address (e.g., `0x3C`). Use `i2cdetect` to scan devices.

### MQTT messages not received
- Verify that the MQTT broker, username, and password are correctly set.
- Check the Home Assistant MQTT integration is active and functional.
- Use a tool like `MQTT Explorer` to debug your messages.

### Add-on not appearing in UI
- Make sure the folder name **exactly matches** the slug in `config.json`, using only lowercase and hyphens.
- Restart Home Assistant and verify the `config.json` file is valid.

### Add-on fails to start
- Check logs via **Supervisor > Add-ons > Logs**.
- Ensure the I2C device (e.g., `/dev/i2c-1`) is exposed and detected.
